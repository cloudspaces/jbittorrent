Package: trackerBT

Description:

   This package aims at providing users a simple and easy-to-use Bittorrent tracker 
   that can be easily configurable and usable.

   The trackerBT tracker is a stand-alone tracker, in the sense that it does not 
   require the previous installation of a web server, database or other program. 
   It relies on Simple Web server (http://www.simpleframework.org), a web server 
   API that permit to serve files as much as creating new services. Therefore it 
   reuses some libraries necessary to Simple Web to work.

   The trackerBT tracker does not need any database to be installed. It only uses 
   XML files to store information about the torrents it is owning and the peers that 
   are sharing. This has require the use of the jdom library, a library for 
   reading, processing and creating XML files.

   All these external libraries can be found in the ext directory, and must specified 
   at compiling or running time.


Installation:
   
   - From the src directory, compile the files. It is 
     necessary to include the necessary library using the -cp or -classpath option.
     To avoid using the -cp [jarFiles;] option, you can set it by
     For example if user unpack trackerBT and lib in the same directory, from a 
     console using the command (you can simply copy/paste the following line):

        javac -cp ext/ant.jar;ext/freemarker.jar;ext/groovy.jar;ext/jaxen-core.jar;ext/jaxen-jdom.jar;ext/jdom.jar;ext/kxml.jar;ext/saxpath.jar;ext/simple-upload-0.3.4.jar;ext/velocity.jar;ext/xalan.jar;ext/xerces.jar;ext/xml-apis.jar trackerBT/*.java

   - To run trackerBT, a configuration file is needed. An example of such a file is 
     provided in the 'config.xml'. Feel free to change parameters in it according to 
     your needs.
        - 'config.xml' contains several information for the tracker to run properly.
          The existing is the default configuration and can be modified to match 
          user requirement. The parameters are:
             - context: the root of the tracker, where all files will be searched for
                        Either relative or absolute path, it must end with a "/"
             - peerXML: the path and file that will be used to store information 
                           about the peers sharing torrents owned by this tracker
             - torrentXML: the path and file that will be used to store information 
                           about the torrents owned by this tracker
             - torrentsDir: the directory where all torrents owned by this tracker 
                            will be saved into
             - servername: the name that will be assigned to this tracker in http 
                           request
             - listeningPort: the port number this tracker will be listening on

Note: Running the tracker create a 'Mapper.xml' file in the context root of the 
      tracker. This files contains mapping of the tracker URL to several services.
      It must not be removed since it is needed by Simple Web to work properly. For 
      information, here are explained the parameter in it:
          In the 'lookup' section, no change should be made if user did not create 
          new services since it maps each service name to the corresponding 
          JAVA class.
          In the 'resolve' section, user can map specific URL to a given service by 
          specifying the URL form (in the parameter 'path') and the corresponding 
          service name (described in the lookup section).
          By default, the tracker listens for:
             - torrents upload on the URL of the form "host:listeningport/upload"
             - peers list request on the URL of the form "host:listeningport/announce
             - any other URL form are considered a file request and the tracker try 
               to find and serve the corresponding file (for example torrent files)

Execution:

   Simply run the program from the installation directory specifying the 
   classpath. For example with the following command and if the ext and trackerBT 
   directory are in the same directory:

      java -cp ext/ant.jar;ext/freemarker.jar;ext/groovy.jar;ext/jaxen-core.jar;ext/jaxen-jdom.jar;ext/jdom.jar;ext/kxml.jar;ext/saxpath.jar;ext/simple-upload-0.3.4.jar;ext/velocity.jar;ext/xalan.jar;ext/xerces.jar;ext/xml-apis.jar;. trackerBT.Tracker
